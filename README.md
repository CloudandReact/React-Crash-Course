# React Crash Course 2021 (Task Tracker App)

This is the project from the [YouTube crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8). It includes the react ui as well as JSON-server for our mock backend

> **Info**:  I cloned and reset to a previous commit because I saw that there were some additions which changed the features. I may try to add a PR in the future.

```
npm start

### Run the JSON server (http://localhost:5000)
